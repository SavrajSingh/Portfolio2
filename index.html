        <h1>Who Am I Really...?</h1>
        <p>I have always liked to think of myself as an extroverted introvert. I love being the center of attention as much as I love being alone all day to read and just day dream. This means that I can relate to almost anyone in the tech space. I make friends quickly and love working in a team environment but I can also work alone on a task with minimal input. <br> I started out as an engineer but quickly realized it was not exactly what I wanted so I proactively started looking for other avenues that piqued my interest. And as soon as I landed on software development I knew it was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I like having a problem that can be solved with a lot of patience and a little ingenuity. If you are looking for someone to come into a project ready to be a positive force then look no further. <br> Check out my resume below!</p>

          <p>This was my first crack at working with other developers in a group setting. This application was built as a way for people in a city to put up their favorite places to go eat, drink or sight-see. We also implemented a upvote system along with google maps and weather based on location. All of this is populated from the back end that was set up in Ruby, shown to the client using Angular and hosted on Heroku. Try it out! Washington, DC already has a few great places but you can make one for you home town. <br> <a style="display:flex; flex-direction:column; justify-content:center; align-items:center; text-align:center" class="button is-primary is-medium" href="https://ericanorby.github.io/Venture_Forth/#/home">Check it out!</a> </p>

          <p>This was my first application that was made with back-end functionality. The logic and UI were both made with Ruby on rails. This application also has user authenticity that was implemented using devise. This application is to be used as a story board for like minded individuals. There are pre-populated stories premises with which users can add comments in a chain and make a rpg like story. I also decided to style this application using Bootstrap. It helped with setting the structure for the page and it showed me how to implement new technologies on my webpages. <br> <a style="display:flex; flex-direction:column; justify-content:center; align-items:center; text-align:center" class="button is-primary is-medium" href="https://intense-sierra-73807.herokuapp.com/">Check it out!</a></p>

          <p>This was the first project that I worked on. The assignment was to make a functioning hangman game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery. This was my first real challenge as a developer because I had to take everything I had learned and put it together for the first time. I learned how to use my resources like peers, the internet, and my mentors. The application also tested my time management and prioritization. I also learned how to keep all of my files updated and current on GitHub. <br> <a style="display:flex; flex-direction:column; justify-content:center; align-items:center; text-align:center" class="button is-primary is-medium" href="https://savrajsingh.github.io/Project-1/">Check it out!</a></p>
